/**
 * Complete the Problem2 class to draw the 
 * figure described here.
 *
 * Draw two concentric circles.(That means they 
 * have the same center) Put the center at (25,30). 
 * The larger circle has a radius of 20 and the 
 * smaller has a radius of 10.
 * 
 * Draw a line tangent to (touching) the larger circle 
 * at the topmost point. Make the 
 * line length the diameter of the circle
 * 
 * Draw the larger circle in the predefined color 
 * from the Color class:
 * blue
 * 
 * Draw the line in the custom color where 
 * red is200
 * green is 100
 * blue is 25
 * 
 * HINT: Notice that you are given th center of the Circle, 
 * but to draw an Ellipse you need to calculate the upper 
 * left-hand corner of the bounding rectangle
 * 
 * HINT: Images problem2x.png in the folder show the 
 * relationships among the three figures. Your drawing will be 
 * similar to one of them. Your colors and location may be different.
 * 
 * Formulas
 * Volume of a Sphere: v = 4/3 pi r^3
 * Volume of a Cylinder: v = pi r^2 h
